Hi, I am Christophe Math√©, currently a postdoc researcher at LATMOS/CNRS.

I am working on the atmospheres of Mars and Titan. I program mainly in Fortran, Python, and bash. 

This GitHub is for personal projects. You can find my research scripts and a beginning of an RPG game.

You can contact me at this address: christophe.mathe77@outlook.fr
